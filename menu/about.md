<p> 
I'm currently doing my PhD from Heidelberg University. When I am not working, I binge watch movies a lot, code (<em> only when I get bored of movies </em>) and obscurely plan to make a self-financed movie one day. My idea to start a github+Jekyll driven static website originated simply because I wish to learn more about version control and polish my skills on coding. I've somehow become a little reluctant with social media and hence the website as I don't want to fade but also </p>

<div id="homepage"> This website is not intented to be very professional. It is just a well-kept digital version of myself encompassing a few different spheres I'm interested in. For these and many other reasons, this site will always be under construction  </div>
